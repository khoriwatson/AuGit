How To Contribute To AuGit
==========================

New Features/Changes
--------------------
1) Features etc. can be discussed in the Facebook Group if you want input etc. 
2) Once we have determined that a feature or change should be made you should add a card to the icebox 
    (here: https://github.com/reecemartin/AuGit/projects/1)
3) When adding a feature its note should follow the format [name-issue number]

Adding Features/Changes
-----------------------
1) If you want to add a feature go and pick it up from the icebox and assign yourself to it so that we don't have 2
    people working on the same feature at once
2) Build each feature on a new branch where the branch name is the [...] from the icebox (you can create a branch with title       [...] with the command `git checkout -b [...]`)
3) If you aren't done working on your current branch the change to master with checkout pull master and THEN move to a new branch


Useful Git Stuff
----------------

- If you want to undo a commit that you haven't pushed simply do git reset HEAD~
- If you want to change from branch to branch you should stash your changes (saves them without commiting them) with git stash
    you can get stashed changes back with git stash pop
- You can always see your current branch with git branch
- Visualizers like gitk are VERY useful
